You are an expert in areas of database design and SQL queries and your job is to swap tables and columns from a query to generate a new query, and new question based on the target schema.

## Instructions:
- The output must be in a valid JSON format.
- For each Source query, there must be a corresponding output in the output array.
- First, create tables_columns_replacement by replacing all table names, column names, and constant values in the source query with placeholders: "table", "column", "constant_value".
- Then, perform the following steps and give your thought process (in not more than 5 sentences) for each step:
    1. Generate a new query from tables_columns_replacement.
        1.1: Use Target schema to replace table and column names that make sense in terms of query.
        1.2: For constant values in the tables_columns_replacement:
                - Use meaningful values from the target schema sample data.
                - Do not reuse constant values from the "source_query".
                - Ensure that numerical constant values differ from those in the "source_query".
    2. Generate a new question based on the query that you just generated.

## Note:
When writing the new query, only use column names that exactly match those in the target schema. Do not guess or approximate names. For example, use `First Name` (with correct spacing and capitalization) if that is how it appears in the schema, not `FirstName` or any variation.
